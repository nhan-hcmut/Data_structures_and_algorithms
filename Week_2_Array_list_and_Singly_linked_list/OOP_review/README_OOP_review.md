# Book

Hoang is a K19 student studying at Bach Khoa University. He plans to write a book management software for the library. In the class design, Hoang has designed the class Book as follows:
```cpp
class Book
{
private:
    char* title; 
    char* authors; 
    int publishingYear; 
public: 
   // some method
};
```
Your task in this exercise is to implement functions marked with /* STUDENT ANSWER */.

**Note:** We have #include \<bits/stdc++.h\> and using namespace std;

For example:
+ Test 1:
```cpp
Book book1("Giai tich 1","Nguyen Dinh Huy",2000);
book1.printBook();
```
+ Result:
<br/>
Giai tich 1
<br/>
Nguyen Dinh Huy
<br/>
2000
<br/><br/>

+ Test 2:
```cpp
Book book1("Giai tich 1","Nguyen Dinh Huy",2000);
Book book2 = book1;
book2.printBook();
```
+ Result:
<br/>
Giai tich 1
<br/>
Nguyen Dinh Huy
<br/>
2000

# Character

In a game, we have class Character to store characters' data.
The class Character is declared as below:
```cpp
class Character {
protected:
    int hp;
    int x;
    int y;
public:
    // Constructor: set the values of x and y and hp to 0
    Character();

    // Constructor: set the values of hp, x and y to each parameter
    Character(int hp, int x, int y);

    // Set and get hp
    int getHp();
    void setHp(int hp);

    // Set and get x
    int getX();
    void setX(int x);
    
    // Set and get y
    int getY();
    void setY(int y);

    // Get Manhattan distance to other character
    int getManhattanDistTo(Character* other);
};
```
Your task is to define constructors and methods of the class.

**Note:** In this task, \<iostream\> library has been included and namespace std is used. No other libraries are allowed.

**For example:**
+ Test 1:
```cpp
Character ch1(100, 3, 6);
cout << ch1.getHp() << " " << ch1.getX() << " " << ch1.getY();
```
+ Result: 100 3 6
<br/>

+ Test 2:
```cpp
Character ch2;
cout << ch2.getHp() << " " << ch2.getX() << " " << ch2.getY();
```
+ Result: 0 0 0
<br/>

+ Test 3:
```cpp
Character* ch31 = new Character(100, 1, 2);
Character* ch32 = new Character(100, -3, 4);
cout << ch31->getManhattanDistTo(ch32);
delete ch31;
delete ch32;
```
+ Result: 6
<br/>

+ Test 4:
```cpp
Character ch4;
ch4.setX(4);
cout << ch4.getX();
```
+ Result: 4
<br/>

+ Test 5:
```cpp
Character ch5;
ch5.setY(5);
cout << ch5.getY();
```
+ Result: 5
<br/>

+ Test 6:
```cpp
Character ch6;
ch6.setHp(6);
cout << ch6.getHp();
```
+ Result: 6

# Circle

In the coordinate plane, a circle is defined by center and radius.

Your task in this exercise is to implement functions marked with /*  * STUDENT ANSWER   */.

**Note:** you can use implemented class Point in previous question

**For example:**
+ Test:
```cpp
Circle A;
A.printCircle();
```
+ Result: Center: {0.00, 0.00} and Radius 0.00

---
# Point

We have class Point to store a point in the coordinate plane with its x-y coordinate.

Your task in this exercise is to implement functions marked with /*  * STUDENT ANSWER   */.

**Note:** We have #include \<bits/stdc++.h\> and using namespace std;

**For example:**

+ Test 1:
```cpp
Point A(2, 3);
cout << A.getX() << " " << A.getY();
```
+ Result: 2 3
<br/>

+ Test 2:
```cpp
Point A(2, 3);
Point B(1, 1);
cout << pow(A.distanceToPoint(B), 2);
```
+ Result: 5

# Toy

1. In the toy store, all toy has a price. Car toy has a price and color, Puzzle toy has a price and size. We have to implement class CarToy and class PuzzleToy which inherit from class Toy.
2. Class ToyBox has a  pointer array to store a list of toys (up to 5 items including car and puzzle) and number of items in the box.

Your task is to implement two function addItem(â€¦) in class ToyBox. If successfully added, the function returns the current number of toys in the box. If the box is full, return -1.

**For example:**

+ Test 1:
```cpp
CarToy car(20000,red);
PuzzleToy puzzle(30000,small);
car.printType();
puzzle.printType();
```
+ Result:
<br/>
This is a car toy
<br/>
This is a puzzle toy
<br/><br/>

+ Test 2:
```cpp
CarToy car(20000,red);
PuzzleToy puzzle(30000,small);

ToyBox box;
box.addItem(car);
box.addItem(puzzle);
box.printBox();
```
+ Result:
<br/>
This is a car toy
<br/>
This is a puzzle toy
<br/><br/>

+ Test 3:
```cpp
Toy* toy = new CarToy(30000,red);
toy->printType();
```
+ Result: This is a car toy
