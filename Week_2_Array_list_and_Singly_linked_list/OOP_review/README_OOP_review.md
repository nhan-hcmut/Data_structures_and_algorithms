# Point.cpp

We have class Point to store a point in the coordinate plane with its x-y coordinate.

Your task in this exercise is to implement functions marked with /*  * STUDENT ANSWER   */.

**Note:** We have #include \<bits/stdc++.h\> and using namespace std;

**For example:**

+ Test 1:
```cpp
Point A(2, 3);
cout << A.getX() << " " << A.getY();
```
+ Result: 2 3
<br/>

+ Test 2:
```cpp
Point A(2, 3);
Point B(1, 1);
cout << pow(A.distanceToPoint(B), 2);
```
+ Result: 5
