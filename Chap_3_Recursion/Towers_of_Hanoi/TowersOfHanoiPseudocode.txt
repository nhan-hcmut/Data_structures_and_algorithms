Algorithm move(val disks <integer>, val source <string>, val destination <string>, val auxiliary <string>)
    Move disks from source to destination.
    
    Pre-condition: disks is the number of disks to be moved.
    Post-condition: print steps to move disks from source to destination.

    if disks = 1 then
        print "Move a disk from " + source + " to " + destination
    else do
        move(disks-1, source, auxiliary, destination)
        move(1, source, destination, auxiliary)
        move(disks-1, auxiliary, destination, source)
    end if
End algorithm
