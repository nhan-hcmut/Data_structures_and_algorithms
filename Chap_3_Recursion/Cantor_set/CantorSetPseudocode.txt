Algorithm printXRecursively(val n<integer>)
    Pre: Integer variables order and stop have been declared and initialized.
    Post: A line of the Cantor set is printed.

Algorithm printCantorSet
    Pre: The order of Cantor set is between 1 and 5.
    Post: The Cantor set is printed by using 'X' characters and spaces.
