# Recommended order to implement:

class Point -> class Circle -> class Character -> class Book -> class CarToy -> class PuzzleToy -> class ToyBox

# class Book

Hoang is a K19 student studying at Bach Khoa University. He plans to write a book management software for the library. In the class design, Hoang has designed the `class Book` as follows:
```cpp
class Book
{
private:
    char* title;
    char* authors;
    int publishingYear;
public:
   // some method
};
```
Your task in this exercise is to implement the functions marked with `/* STUDENT ANSWER */`.

**<ins>Note</ins>:** `<bits/stdc++.h>` header and the `std` namespace are already included.

**<ins>For example</ins>:**
+ Test 1:
```cpp
Book book1("Giai tich 1","Nguyen Dinh Huy",2000);
book1.printBook();
```
+ Result:
<br/>
Giai tich 1
<br/>
Nguyen Dinh Huy
<br/>
2000
<br/><br/>

+ Test 2:
```cpp
Book book1("Giai tich 1","Nguyen Dinh Huy",2000);
Book book2 = book1;
book2.printBook();
```
+ Result:
<br/>
Giai tich 1
<br/>
Nguyen Dinh Huy
<br/>
2000

# class Character

In a game, we have `class Character` that stores the data of individual characters. The `class Character` is declared as follows:
```cpp
class Character {
protected:
    int hp;
    int x;
    int y;
public:
    // Constructor: set the values of x and y and hp to 0
    Character();

    // Constructor: set the values of hp, x and y to each parameter
    Character(int hp, int x, int y);

    // Set and get hp
    int getHp();
    void setHp(int hp);

    // Set and get x
    int getX();
    void setX(int x);
    
    // Set and get y
    int getY();
    void setY(int y);

    // Get Manhattan distance to other character
    int getManhattanDistTo(Character* other);
};
```
Your task is to define the constructors and member methods of the `Character` class.

**<ins>Note</ins>:** In this task, the `<iostream>` library and the `std` namespace are already included. **<ins>No</ins>** additional libraries are allowed.

**<ins>For example</ins>:**
+ Test 1:
```cpp
Character ch1(100, 3, 6);
cout << ch1.getHp() << " " << ch1.getX() << " " << ch1.getY() << endl; // Result: 100 3 6
```
<br/>

+ Test 2:
```cpp
Character ch2;
cout << ch2.getHp() << " " << ch2.getX() << " " << ch2.getY() << endl; // Result: 0 0 0
```
<br/>

+ Test 3:
```cpp
Character* ch31 = new Character(100, 1, 2);
Character* ch32 = new Character(100, -3, 4);
cout << ch31->getManhattanDistTo(ch32) << endl; // Result: 6
delete ch31;
delete ch32;
```
<br/>

+ Test 4:
```cpp
Character ch4;
ch4.setX(4);
cout << ch4.getX() << endl; // Result: 4
```
<br/>

+ Test 5:
```cpp
Character ch5;
ch5.setY(5);
cout << ch5.getY() << endl; // Result: 5
```
<br/>

+ Test 6:
```cpp
Character ch6;
ch6.setHp(6);
cout << ch6.getHp() << endl; // Result: 6
```

# class Circle

In the coordinate plane, a circle is defined by its center and radius.

Your task in this exercise is to implement the functions marked with `/*  * STUDENT ANSWER   */`.

**<ins>Note</ins>:** you can use the `Point` class implemented in the previous question.

**<ins>For example</ins>:**
+ Test:
```cpp
Circle A;
A.printCircle();
```
+ Result: Center: {0.00, 0.00} and Radius 0.00

---
# class Point

In the coordinate plane, we have `class Point` to store a point with its x-y coordinate.

Your task in this exercise is to implement the functions marked with `/*  * STUDENT ANSWER   */`.

**<ins>Note</ins>:** The `<bits/stdc++.h>` header and the `std` namespace are already included.

**<ins>For example</ins>:**

+ Test 1:
```cpp
Point A(2, 3);
cout << A.getX() << " " << A.getY() << endl; // Result: 2 3
```
<br/>

+ Test 2:
```cpp
Point A(2, 3);
Point B(1, 1);
cout << pow(A.distanceToPoint(B), 2) << endl; // Result: 5
```

# Toy

1. In the toy store, all toys have a price. The car toy has a price and a color. The puzzle toy has a price and a size. We have to implement the `CarToy` and `PuzzleToy` classes which inherit from the `Toy` class.
2. The `ToyBox` class has a pointer array to store a list of toys (up to 5 items, including cars and puzzles) and a variable for the number of items in the box.

Your task is to implement two addItem(â€¦) functions in the `ToyBox` class. If an item is successfully added, the function returns the current number of toys in the box. If the box is full, it returns -1.

The `<bits/stdc++.h>` header and the `std` namespace are already included.

**<ins>For example</ins>:**

+ Test 1:
```cpp
CarToy car(20000,red);
PuzzleToy puzzle(30000,small);
car.printType();
puzzle.printType();
// Result:
// This is a car toy
// This is a puzzle toy
```

+ Test 2:
```cpp
CarToy car(20000,red);
PuzzleToy puzzle(30000,small);

ToyBox box;
box.addItem(car);
box.addItem(puzzle);
box.printBox();
// Result:
// This is a car toy
// This is a puzzle toy
```

+ Test 3:
```cpp
Toy* toy = new CarToy(30000,red);
toy->printType(); // Result: This is a car toy
```
